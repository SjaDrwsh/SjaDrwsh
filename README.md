## Hi, I'm Saja 👋

I'm a **Senior Design and Frontend Developer** with over **10 years of experience** crafting **scalable web applications** that not only work but shine! I specialize in **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **ReactJS**, and **Angular**, and I’m passionate about **UI/UX magic**, clean code, and driving projects to success through seamless collaboration.

I love **bridging design and engineering**. I focus on converting design systems into reusable, maintainable code and work closely with designers to ensure **pixel-perfect** UIs. I have a deep understanding of **UI/UX consistency**, **accessibility**, and **design tokens**, and I am experienced in building and maintaining **component libraries** that improve scalability and consistency across applications.
